## Table Data 
**Dataset requirements**: Choose a dataset that is mostly ready to be analyzed. That is, it is already in the format of table data. The following requirements should be met:

1. The data includes categorical features (it can also include other forms of data, but must have categorical data)
2. The data must be 1,000 rows or larger
3. The data is not strictly image or text data (but could have these data)
4. The dataset should have some prediction task associated with it (i.e., labels to learn, classification)
